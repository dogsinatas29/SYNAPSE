# Release Notes - v0.1.7

## 🚀 Bug Fixes & Packaging
- **Activation Fix**: Resolved "command not found" errors after reload by explicitly defining activation events for all commands.
- **Dependency Bundle**: Fixed `.vscodeignore` to ensure `node_modules` are included in the VSIX package, preventing activation crashes due to missing libraries.
- **Verbose Logging**: Added internal logs (`[SYNAPSE]`) to track activation progress and identify failure points.

# Release Notes - v0.1.6

## 📜 Legal & Documentation
- **GPL 3.0 License**: Confirmed and added license information to all README files.
- **Header Standardization**: Ensured GPL 3.0 headers are present in core source files.

# Release Notes - v0.1.5

## 🔧 Maintenance
- Internal optimizations for extension activation and path resolving.
- Refined styling of the visual canvas for better consistency.

# Release Notes - v0.1.4

## 🚀 Hotfix: Always-On Thought Stream
- **Global Keybinding (Zero-Context Activation)**: `Ctrl+Alt+M` now works globally, even on an empty workbench (Welcome Page).
- **Auto-Sync**: The canvas now automatically detects new prompt logs in the `prompts/` folder and refreshes instantly.

# Release Notes - v0.1.3

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Keybinding Activation**: Fixed an issue where `Ctrl+Alt+M` would not trigger the command if the extension wasn't already active.
- **Context Relaxation**: Removed restrictive `when` clauses to allow broader access to the prompt logger.

# Release Notes - v0.1.2

## ✨ New Feature: Prompt Traceability Engine
- **Strategic Command**: `Ctrl+Alt+M` (or `Synapse: Log Prompt`) to instantly capture your design thoughts.
- **Structured Parsing**: Automatically extracts `# Goal`, `# Decision`, `# Context` from your prompts.
- **Origin Edge**: Referenced files in your prompt (e.g., `[src/main.ts](src/main.ts)`) are visualized as **Origin Edges** on the canvas, showing the "Cause & Effect" of your decisions.
- **Git Auto-Staging**: Every logged prompt is automatically saved as a Markdown file in `prompts/` and staged to Git.
