# Release Notes - v0.2.17

## [Summary]
This release completely eliminates visual clutter by filtering out empty clusters, blacklisting root boilerplate files, and disabling ghost node rendering for deleted items.

## [Changes]
- **Empty Cluster Suppression**: Directories without valid source code or sub-clusters are no longer rendered as empty boxes at $(0,0)$.
- **Strict Boilerplate Blacklist**: The following root files are now automatically hidden to keep the canvas focused on core architecture:
    - `webpack.config.js`
    - `verify_rules.js`
    - `verify_rules_only.js`
    - `test_tree_logic.js`
- **Ghost Node Deactivation**: "Removed" node indicators (dotted boxes for deleted files) have been disabled. Deleting a node now truly removes it from the view.
- **Version Bump**: Bumped to **v0.2.17**.

## [Status: Verified by Commander]
