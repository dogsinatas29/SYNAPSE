# Release Notes - v0.2.18 Debug Release

## [Summary]
This release is a specialized debugging build designed to pinpoint why the SYNAPSE canvas hangs on "Loading...". It adds granular progress logging to the backend engine.

## [Changes]
- **Detailed Progress Logging**:
    - Added backend logs to track file scanning progress (every 20 nodes).
    - Added backend logs to track edge discovery progress (every 20 nodes).
    - Added "Preparing state for webview" marker to confirm the end of processing.
- **Fixed Package Identity**: Ensured the internal versioning matches the build target.

## [How to Debug]
1. Install this VSIX.
2. Open the SYNAPSE canvas.
3. Open VS Code **Developer Tools** (`Help` -> `Toggle Developer Tools`).
4. Select the `Console` tab.
5. Filter by `[SYNAPSE]`.
6. Watch the progress logs. If it stops, note the last message (e.g., `Scanned 40/122 nodes`).
