# 🚀 SYNAPSE v0.1.9 Release Notes

## 🏁 Logical Flow Refinement & Ghost Node Isolation

This release fixes critical "fatal defects" in the architecture visualization, turning it from a static file map into a functional logical command center.

### ➡️ Flow View Improvements
- **Explicit Entry/Exit**: Added **[START]** and **[END]** markers to clearly anchor the execution logic.
- **Functional Prioritization**: The flow now correctly identifies `main.rs`, `index.ts`, or `App.js` as the root entry points, excluding project metadata like `Cargo.toml` from the logic sequence.
- **Semantic Branching**: "True/False" labels and Diamond (Decision) shapes are now intelligently reserved for logic-heavy files (Routers, Checkers, Enforcers). Linear file dependencies are now rendered as clean process blocks.

### 🌐 Graph View Clarity
- **📦 Ghost Node Storage**: Isolated disconnected nodes (degree 0) into a dedicated "Ghost Nodes (Storage)" cluster to declutter the primary architectural layers.
- **Wider Banding**: Increased horizontal spacing (350px) to prevent overlap in complex reasoning layers.

### 🐍 Enhanced Multi-Language Parsing
- **Rust/Python/Shell**: Refined regex patterns to better handle imports, nested dependencies, and script-to-script calls.
