# Release Notes - v0.2.5

## 🧹 Housekeeping & Cleanup
- **Project Root Cleanup**: Removed redundant placeholder files (`CanvasPanel.ts`, `FileScanner.ts`, `extension.ts`, `schema.js`, etc.) from the project root. The codebase is now cleaner and strictly follows the `src/` directory structure.
- **Example File Removal**: Deleted auto-generated example files (`login.py`, `board.py`, `schema.sql`) that were causing confusion.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Focus Stabilization**: Fixed an issue where the canvas camera would reset to default zoom/pan when clicking "Approve" or "Reject" on a node. The view now remains stable, allowing for a smoother review workflow.
- **Ghost Node Exorcism**: Patched `GeminiParser.ts` to correctly ignore file paths inside Markdown code blocks. This prevents example paths in `GEMINI.md` from appearing as disconnected "Ghost Nodes" in the graph.

## ✨ New Features
- **Context-Aware Log Prompt (`Ctrl+Alt+M`)**: 
    - You can now choose to **Append** your design thoughts to a single `context.md` file instead of creating a new file for every log.
    - Added a QuickPick menu to select between "Append to context.md" (Default) and "Create New Log File".
